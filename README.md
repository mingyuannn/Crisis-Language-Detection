# Crisis Language Detection

Mental health crisis-risk screening system using TF-IDF features and machine learning models implemented from scratch with NumPy.

Developed for INFO 5368 — Cornell University.

---

## Project Overview

This project explores automatic detection of suicide-risk language in Reddit posts using classical machine learning approaches.

We implemented:

- Keyword Baseline
- Logistic Regression (from scratch)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes (from scratch)

using TF-IDF text representations.

The project focuses on high-recall crisis screening because false negatives (missing high-risk posts) are especially dangerous in mental health settings.

---

## Final Model

The final deployed model is:

- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Alpha = 1.0

Selected because it achieved the strongest overall performance across Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

## How to Run

### Option 1 — Open Directly in Google Colab

The dataset is too large for GitHub and is automatically downloaded from Google Drive inside the notebook.

Open the notebook directly in Colab:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lLF5JRxlvz9U6sow1j7QhzEIM1Nk3ZVL#scrollTo=B0Yn2BGHy07S

Then:

1. Go to **Runtime > Run all**
2. The dataset will automatically download using `gdown`
3. All experiments, figures, and evaluations will reproduce automatically

> If viewing the `.ipynb` directly on GitHub, pre-rendered outputs and visualizations are still visible without running the notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset is automatically downloaded inside the notebook using Google Drive + gdown.

The notebook automatically fetches:

```python
clean_data.csv
```

during execution.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- text cleaning
- normalization
- TF-IDF vectorization
- train/test splitting

### 2. Modeling
We compared:
- Keyword Baseline
- Logistic Regression
- Multinomial Naive Bayes

### 3. Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- Recall
- Precision
- F1-score
- AUC-ROC
- Accuracy

The project prioritized Recall because minimizing false negatives is especially important in crisis-risk screening.

### 4. Threshold Analysis
We analyzed how different decision thresholds affect Recall and Precision tradeoffs in clinical-style screening settings.

## Evaluation Summary

| Model | Recall | F1-Score | AUC-ROC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Keyword Baseline | 0.369 | 0.525 | 0.666 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.831 | 0.866 | 0.944 |
| Naive Bayes | 0.947 | 0.914 | 0.973 |

Naive Bayes achieved the strongest overall performance and was selected as the final deployed model.
